This repository contains all the hardware and firmware files to build and operate REVOLVER: an automated protein purifier based on paralleled large-scale gravity-column workflows. We also present MULTIVOLVER, a multiplexed version of REVOLVER that allows for simultaneous purification of up to six samples at a time.

REVOLVER was developed by Patrick Diep and Jose L. Cadavid at the University of Toronto. A full and detailed description of our system can be found in this publication (link).
